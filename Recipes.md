Chop your chocolate into small pieces and place in a bowl.
Put your cream in a saucepan and place over medium heat. Allow cream to heat until simmering and almost boiling. Alternatively you can heat the cream in the microwave.
Pour the hot cream over the chopped chocolate and let stand for about 3 minutes. Add your salt into the bowl at this point if using.
Put your whisk into the center of the chocolate/cream mixture and begin whisking in small circles going in one direction and slowly moving outward in bigger circles until the mixture is smooth.
Serve hot if using as for fondue, a chocolate fountain, or sipping chocolate. If using for a glaze or for stiff piping work, allow to cool for about 10 minutes before pouring. If using as a frosting, allow to cool at room temperature for about 4 hours and up to overnight. If making truffles, place the ganache in the refrigerator uncovered until the mixture becomes solid, about 1 hour, before scooping and shaping.
